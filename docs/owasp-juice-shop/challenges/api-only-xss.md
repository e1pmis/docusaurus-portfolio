## 1. Vulnerability Overview
The `PUT /api/Products/:id` endpoint allows modification of product data, including the `description` field.  
The server accepts HTML and JavaScript content in this field without sanitization or encoding.  
If an attacker updates the description with a script payload, it is rendered and executed on the product listing page, triggering stored XSS.

This works even if the product was created via the UIâ€”only the API needs to be used for injection.

## 2. Risk & Impact
* **Stored XSS:** Malicious code is stored on the server and runs in every visitorâ€™s browser.
* **Credential theft:** Attackers can steal session tokens or impersonate users.
* **Admin compromise:** If viewed by an admin, XSS can lead to full backend takeover via CSRF or token theft.
* **Trust damage:** Defacing pages or redirecting users damages business reputation.

## 3. Reproduce Step-by-Step

1. **Launch Juice Shop**
   - Start the OWASP Juice Shop application (locally or in a lab environment).

2. **Intercept Admin Login to Obtain Token**
   - Open **Burp Suite** and enable **Intercept** mode.
   - In your browser, log in to Juice Shop using **admin credentials**.
   - Capture the login request and inspect the **response** in Burp.
   - Copy the **Authorization token** from the response body.

3. **Exploit via PUT Method**
   - Switch to **Burp Repeater** and prepare a `PUT` request to the following endpoint:
     ```
     PUT /api/Products/:id
     ```
     - Replace `:id` with the actual product ID (e.g., `1`).

4. **Add Authentication Header**
   - In the request headers, include:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <copied_token>
     ```
     - Replace `<copied_token>` with the actual obtained from the admin login.

5. **Inject XSS Payload**
   - Use the following JSON payload in the request body:
     ```json
     {
       "description": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\"></iframe>"
     }
     ```

6. **Send the Request**
   - Send the request using Burp Repeater.
   - A `200 OK` response confirms the update was successful.

7. **Trigger the XSS**
   - Open the `/#/search` page or any product listing view in your browser.
   - The XSS payload will execute automatically when the page renders the updated product description.

## 4. Remediation
* **Server-side sanitization:** Strip or escape dangerous tags and attributes (`<script>`, `onload`, etc.).
* **Output encoding:** Apply contextual output encoding on all user-supplied data.
* **Use a security-focused templating engine** to avoid raw HTML injection.
* **Deploy CSP headers** to mitigate the impact of stored XSS vectors.

---

## 5. Notes
* This challenge does not require creating a new product.
* The XSS vector only works if injected via the APIâ€”not the web UI.
* Editing existing objects via vulnerable API endpoints is a common real-world attack technique.
